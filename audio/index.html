    <h3>Script</h3>
    <div class="script-box">
        <p>If you want to speak to ghosts, first you must think of your finite body. 
        Root it into the dirt. Let the bugs walk over you.</p> 
        <p>Next, though never forgetting the distance, wait for clarity. 
        If you sit long enough you will hear it. the bird song. the ghost talk.</p> 
        <p>You have to be a thing of action. But not now. For now, you are a ghost. Settle into a space beneath your body.</p>
        <p>If you don’t spend enough time around ghosts, you will forget how to listen for them and you will forget they exist. 
        Then, when you become one, you will think that all the world has forgotten you. And you will be angry.</p>
        <p>Be a ghost a moment. Listen to them.</p>
        <p>To be a ghost is to be a contradiction.</p>
        <p>Alive enough to have wants and needs. Too dead for autonomy.</p>
        <p>To be a ghost is to be restless.</p>
        <p>You will be grieved and misremembered. You will not move on.</p>
        <p>This narrative is haunted. You are haunting it.</p>
        <p>If you want to know how to haunt a narrative, a person, a place… 
        Watch the people who come in with sweating eyes. Among them, your memory is a weapon. </p>
        <p>You will be defanged. Ghosts don’t get loved away. You should be dead and they will get tired of you.</p>
        <p>You’re thinking it now aren’t you? The ghost thought.</p>
        <p>People often speak to the dead, but they’re not looking for conversation. 
        The dead bear many burdens but none so great as that of mirror.</p>
        <p>The ghost thought, that you will be trapped forever.</p>
