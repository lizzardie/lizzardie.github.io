    <p>Hi there! This one is still a very rough WIP. I've added multiple screens and another object 
      and attempted to use arrays for the first time which kind of spectacularly failed.</p>
    <p>The end intention is that unlike in the first version of the game where leaving the screen
      and refusing to play does nothing, leaving the screen will trigger a BSOD that will then add stakes.</p> 
    <p>Problem solving so far has included: asking classmates and Prof for advice on getting objects embedded in arrays to work.
      A lot of my dead/outdated code and attempts are still in the code behind backslashes. Watching youtube videos
      that explain objects, arrays, and conditionals involving both. Reading p5.js tutorials on all of the above, including
      for other things like timed events and the dist function. And many many hours going through many combinations of the
      proposed fixes. Going to take some time away from this project and hopefully come back with a clearer head.</p>
